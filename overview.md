Sorting children into houses can be time-consuming, but Hogwarts were able to use magic to sort their yearly intake into houses really easily. Let's replace the magic with some code to achieve the same result!

In this lesson, students will create a Raspberry Pi-powered Harry Potter-style sorting hat, using the button on a Pibrella add-on board.

It is assumed that students have prior knowledge of the programming concepts of loops, conditionals and functions in Python. Alternatively, the lesson can also be completed using Scratch.
