# Raspberry Pi Sorting Hat

## Introduction

Sorting children into houses can be time consuming, but with magic Hogwarts were able to sort their yearly intake into houses super easily. Let's replace the magic with some code to achieve the same result!

In this lesson, students will create a Raspberry Pi powered Harry Potter style sorting hat. Students will also learn how to connect a physical button to the Pibrella and program it to control the sorting hat. 

It is assumed that students have prior knowledge of the programming concepts loops, conditionals and functions in Python. Alternatively it can also be achieved using Scratch.

## Students will learn
- How to create a random group generator based on the Harry Potter Sorting Hat.
- How to use functions, variables, randomisation, conditionals and loops.

## Computing Program of Study Met
KS2:
- Design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals; solve problems by breaking them into smaller parts. 
- Select, use and combine a variety of software on a range of digital devices to design and create a range of programs.
- Use sequence, selection and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output
- Use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work; detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs

KS3:
- Use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems. 

## Resources
For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students on a Raspberry Pi in pairs or a small group. Each pair or group should have access to the standard equipment described below:

- A Raspberry Pi
- The latest NOOBS SD card with Raspbian installed
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the Raspberry Pi
- A monitor connected to the Raspberry Pi
- A [Pibrella](http://pibrella.com)
- 1 x speakers or headphones
- Hat

See [teachers setup instructions](teachers-instructions.md) for more information.
